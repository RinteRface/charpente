Description: 'charpente' eases the creation of 'shiny' extensions like 'shinydashboard',
    'bs4Dash', 'shinyMobile'. It provides helpers to quickly set up a relevant package 
    structure, import all external web dependencies (JavaScript, CSS) as well as initialize
    input/output bindings and custom handlers boilerplates. 'charpente' offers tools
    to convert HTML code into R to dramatically speed up the development of the template 
    components as well as an high level interface to 'htmltools'. 
    'charpente' is a chatty package relying on the same principle as 'usethis' and 
    more recently 'golem', that is make ('shiny') developer's life much easier.
